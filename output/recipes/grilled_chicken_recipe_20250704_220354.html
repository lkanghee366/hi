    <!-- Storage Instructions -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h2 class="content-title">Storage Instructions</h2>
        
        <div class="storage-item">
            <h3>Refrigerating Cooked Chicken</h3>
            <p>Allow the grilled chicken to cool completely before storing it in an airtight container. Refrigerate for up to 3-4 days. Ensure the chicken is properly cooled to prevent bacterial growth and maintain its quality. Store in a shallow container to promote even cooling and prevent the chicken from becoming waterlogged. Label the container with the date of preparation for easy tracking.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="storage-item">
            <h3>Freezing Cooked Chicken</h3>
            <p>To freeze, wrap the cooled grilled chicken tightly in plastic wrap, pressing out as much air as possible. Then, place it in a freezer-safe bag or container for added protection. Freeze for up to 2-3 months. Thawing the chicken slowly in the refrigerator overnight helps to preserve its texture and flavor, and avoid freezer burn. Properly wrapping prevents freezer burn and maintains quality, ensuring the chicken remains delicious when reheated.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="storage-item">
            <h3>Reheating Cooked Chicken</h3>
            <p>Reheat the grilled chicken in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for 10-15 minutes, or until heated through. You can also microwave it in 30-second intervals until warm, but be careful not to overcook it. For best results and to retain moisture, add a splash of broth or water during reheating. Covering the chicken with foil while reheating in the oven can also help prevent it from drying out.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="storage-item">
            <h3>Storing Marinated Chicken</h3>
            <p>Marinated chicken can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Beyond that, the lemon juice can start to break down the chicken's texture, making it mushy. Always ensure the chicken is stored in a sealed container or bag to prevent cross-contamination. Place the container on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator to prevent any drips from contaminating other foods. Discard the marinade after use; do not reuse it.</p>

    <!-- Frequently Asked Questions -->
    <div class="content-box">
        <h2 class="content-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Q: How can I prevent the chicken from sticking to the grill?</h4>
            <p>A: Ensure your grill grates are clean and well-oiled before placing the chicken on them. Use a high-heat cooking oil like canola or grapeseed oil to oil the grates. Preheat the grill thoroughly. You can also lightly brush the chicken with oil before grilling to further prevent sticking. Use tongs to flip the chicken gently.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Q: How do I know when the chicken is fully cooked?</h4>
            <p>A: The best way to ensure the chicken is cooked through is to use a meat thermometer. Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken breast. It should read 165°F (74°C). Visual cues include the juices running clear when pierced. If the juices are still pink, continue grilling until the correct temperature is reached.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Q: Can I use dried herbs instead of fresh?</h4>
            <p>A: Yes, you can substitute dried herbs for fresh herbs in this **grilled chicken recipe**. Use about 1 teaspoon of dried herbs for every 1 tablespoon of fresh herbs. Keep in mind that dried herbs have a more concentrated flavor, so adjust accordingly. Dried herbs should be added to the marinade at least 30 minutes before grilling to allow them to rehydrate and release their flavor.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Q: What if I don't have a grill?</h4>
            <p>A: You can pan-sear the chicken in a skillet over medium-high heat, or bake it in the oven at 375°F (190°C) for 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Adjust cooking times based on chicken thickness. When pan-searing, use a cast-iron skillet for best results. Be sure to flip the chicken halfway through cooking.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Q: Can I marinate the chicken for longer than 4 hours?</h4>
            <p>A: While you can technically marinate the chicken for longer, it's generally not recommended to marinate it for more than 24 hours. The lemon juice can start to break down the protein and make the chicken mushy. Optimal marinating time is 30 minutes to 4 hours. If you need to marinate it longer, reduce the amount of lemon juice in the marinade.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Q: How do I get good grill marks on the chicken?</h4>
            <p>A: Ensure your grill is preheated to the correct temperature. Place the chicken on the grill and let it sear undisturbed for a few minutes before rotating it 45 degrees to create crosshatch grill marks. Avoid moving the chicken around too much. Lift the chicken gently with tongs to check the grill marks before rotating.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Q: What are some good side dishes to serve with grilled chicken?</h4>
            <p>A: Grilled vegetables (like zucchini, bell peppers, and corn), salads (such as a caprese salad or a leafy green salad), rice pilaf, quinoa, roasted potatoes, or a simple pasta salad are all excellent choices. Consider seasonal produce for the best flavor. A grilled corn on the cob with a pat of butter and a sprinkle of salt is a perfect addition to this **grilled chicken recipe**.</p>
